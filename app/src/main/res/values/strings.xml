    <string name="about_text">Hello There Ladies and Gentlemen.\n
        This app allows you to control the logo rgb on custom roms.\n\n

        You need to be rooted to use this since it writes to system files.\n\n

        To use it press the power button on the bottom right of the screen.\n
        When it turns green we are good to go and you can head over the animations tab.\n\n

        The Colour wheel allows you to change the colour provided the animations aren\'t rainbow.\n
        Colour wheel will work for the following animations.\n
        solid one colour\n
        breathing one colour\n
        blink\n
        some kind of thunder\n
        quick two flashes\n
        and sort of the last one too\n\n

        If you like what I do you can check out my github, telegram channel by clicking the icons at the top.\n\n

        If you would like to donate :) click on the paypal or patreon icons up above\n\n

        Thanks and Bye Bye
