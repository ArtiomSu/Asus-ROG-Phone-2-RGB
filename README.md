# Asus-ROG-Phone-2-RGB
This app allows you to control the logo rgb on custom roms. 
Works on stock rom too after release 2.0-hotfix

Note I have only tested it on android 10.

#### Only use this if you are using Asus Rog Phone 2
#### You need to be rooted to use this since it writes to system files
#### This modifies system files so use it at your own risk
